Ansel's Comments:

1. Optimize CRP for index.html
I followed the suggestions offered in the advanced video offering suggestions for
optimizing for PageSpeed. The suggestion that satisfied the requirement was to
include the css in the html file. I have a PageSpeed of 99/100 for both mobile
and desktop.

2. Optimize Frame Rate scrolling in pizza.html
Again, I followed the suggestions offered in the advanced video. Some of the
suggestions I thought of before watching the video, kudos to me. I tried a few
optimizations, some worked and some didn't. I tried css' transform: translateX;
but it didn't work and I realized that it wouldn't have much impact on performance.
I wonder why it's there???

One comment. I used the Frame Rate HUD display to measure the frame rate. It
gave really low results. I saw fps' from 8fps to about 20fps; but when I ran the
code through devtools' timing utility, the fps was very high. I'm not sure what's
going on. I tried using the fps in Firefox, but the code doesn't appear to work -
the pizza's don'g move when scrolling.


3. Optimize Computational Efficiency for resizing pizza in pizza.html
Here, I used the suggestions given in the video for stopping FSL. I thought the
resizing of the pizza was really complicated, the video helped me realize that
my suspicion was correct.

 Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
